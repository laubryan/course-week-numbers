# Course Week Numbers

Simple Python script that adds a series of consecutive week numbers to a user's primary Google calendar, to help keep track of progress. 
I find it useful in cases where it's a course composed of many weeks and where you might be able to get ahead by one or more weeks.

Script prompts for:

- A title prefix
- Event description
- Start date
- Number of events to create
- Time zone
- Event color (as defined by Google Calendar)

Requires setup of credentials via Google Cloud Console.
